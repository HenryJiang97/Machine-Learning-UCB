Classification of Iris Flower Datasets Using Decision Trees

1. Aimed to differentiate Iris-Versicolor and Iris Virginica by employing ID3 decision tree algorithm which used entropy as the metrics
2. Calculated the entropy for each unused input variables, and selected the one with smallest entropy as the cut-off variable, based on which the training data set was split
3. Concluded that the petal width of virginica class is greater that 1.75 and that of versicolor is between 0.8 and 1.75
4. Generalized the results using precision rate and f1 score as metrics to reflect the classifier performance
5. Performed 5-fold cross-validation to achieve a satisfactory accuracy of 0.9
